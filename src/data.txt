TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
TypeScript builds on top of JavaScript. First, you write the TypeScript code. 
Then, you compile the TypeScript code into plain JavaScript code using a TypeScript compiler.
TypeScript uses the JavaScript syntaxes and adds additional syntaxes for supporting Types.
Types increase productivity by helping you avoid many mistakes. 
By using types, you can catch bugs at the compile time instead of having them occur at runtime.
For example :
function add(x,y){
    return x+y;
}
let result = add(input1.value, input2.value);
here we may get the result in form of concatenated stings 
therefore if we use TypeScript
function add(x:number,y:number){
    return x+y;
}
we can avoid the error 
The never type contains no value.
The never type represents the return type of a function that always throws an error or a function that contains an indefinite loop.
